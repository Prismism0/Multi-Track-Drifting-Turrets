### NOTE:
This plugin is a client-side plugin. **When in multiplayer, only players that have this plugin will hear the music.** (doesn't matter who is playing Engineer).


## What this plugin does
Engineer's alternate turrets (the mobile Carbonizer turrets) will loop a sample of Deja Vu by Dave Rodgers when they are moving fast. The faster they are moving and the more goat hooves they have, the louder the effect.

It is as silly as it sounds.
